This data analysis project has two general objectives. The first is to explore the reasons why Seattle's immigrants and refugees do or do not choose to participate in civic activites. The second is to explore the certain factors such as education level, english speaking ability, english proficiency, income, gender and age as potential barriers to civic engagement among Seattle's immigrants and refugees. This data analysis uses a public domain dataset provided by the City of Seattle. The dataset is comprised of survey data collected in 2016 from Seattle and King County's Immigrants and Refugees.
